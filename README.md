# GettingCleaningData
Coursera Project on Getting and Cleaning Data
This project is intended to create a tidy data set using raw data on activities 
collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. Data files on
activies are obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

CodeBook.md describes the input files, the output files and the steps undertaken.

run_analysis.R contains the code required to generate the output. 

The final file is called "summary" which is a text file uploaded separately.
